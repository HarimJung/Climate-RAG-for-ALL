# CO2 Per Capita Trend Comparison (2000-2023)

> Phase 2 Analysis | Generated: 2026-02-12
> Source indicator: `EN.GHG.CO2.PC.CE.AR5` from `country_data` table
> Unit: metric tons CO2 equivalent per capita
> Confidence: MEDIUM (single source - Climate Watch / WDI)

## Methodology

- **Base year**: 2000
- **Comparison**: Latest available year (2022 or 2023)
- **Formula**: Change % = ((Latest Value - 2000 Value) / 2000 Value) x 100
- **Countries**: 6 pilot countries (KOR, USA, DEU, BRA, NGA, BGD)

## Results (Ranked by Change %)

| Rank | Country | ISO3 | 2000 Value | Latest Year | Latest Value | Change % | Trend |
|------|---------|------|-----------|-------------|-------------|---------|-------|
| 1 | United States | USA | 21.01 | 2023 | 13.71 | -34.7% | Decreasing |
| 2 | Germany | DEU | 10.60 | 2023 | 7.08 | -33.2% | Decreasing |
| 3 | Nigeria | NGA | 0.79 | 2023 | 0.55 | -30.3% | Decreasing |
| 4 | Brazil | BRA | 2.01 | 2023 | 2.27 | +13.3% | Increasing |
| 5 | South Korea | KOR | 9.92 | 2023 | 11.42 | +15.1% | Increasing |
| 6 | Bangladesh | BGD | 0.20 | 2023 | 0.69 | +246.1% | Increasing |

## Analysis

Among the six pilot countries, United States (-34.7%), Germany (-33.2%), Nigeria (-30.3%) showed declining per-capita CO2 emissions from 2000 to their latest available year. In contrast, Brazil (+13.3%), South Korea (+15.1%), Bangladesh (+246.1%) showed increasing per-capita emissions over the same period. 

This pattern reflects a broader global trend: high-income economies (United States, Germany) have been reducing per-capita emissions through energy efficiency improvements and decarbonization policies, while developing economies (Brazil, Bangladesh) are still on upward trajectories driven by industrialization and rising energy demand. The absolute emissions per capita in developing countries remain far below those of high-income nations, even after years of growth.
